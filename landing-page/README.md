# Landing Page Project

## Description

This is a landing page that uses JavaScript to dynamically build a navigation bar based on the sections of the page.
When a specific section is in the viewport, its background turns to black and it's highlighted in the navigation bar.
When a section is clicked from the navigation bar, the page smoothly scrolls to that section.
